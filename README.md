# RainbowZ Editor
 
 IMPORTANT
 This requires a 1.0 U version of DKC1 to work properly.
 
 For a quick download, go [here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1720/). Just make sure you update here after.
 
 
Here you can find the most up-to-date version of this. 
Make sure you download the assets FIRST. Then, download the RainbowZ Editor program and put it in the deepmost 'RainbowZ Editor' folder. 
[Assets](https://github.com/mike19283/RainbowZ-Editor/blob/main/RainbowZ_Editor_Assets.zip)

This is the latest ASM folder. I'll often push more. If you already have all of the above, you only need to unzip and replace this folder.
[ASM](https://github.com/mike19283/RainbowZ-Editor/blob/main/ASM.zip)

And finally here is the program.
[RainbowZ Editor](https://github.com/mike19283/RainbowZ-Editor/blob/main/RainbowZ%20Editor.exe)

NOTE!
You do not need to download the assets after you have them once! The only thing you need to update is ASM and the editor! The backing code may not be up to date. But the program should be!

This program assumes it will be used properly! It is very easy to break things!
